# Sirens: A Data Sonification of the COVID-19 Pandemic

This project is my first work in Data Sonification, which I completed during my 4th semester at Brown University. I am concentrating in both Applied Math - Computer Science and Music; through this project, I have found a way to tie together these two interests.
I was inspired to begin this project by a round table discussion I had with data journalist Mona Chalabi, sponsored by Brown's Data Science Initiative. We were discussing creative ways of displaying data through non-visual mediums, for example depicting rising and falling data using sound waves. My mind immediately jumped to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and how I could recreate rising and falling case counts via sound, perhaps on a global scale.

## Part 1: starterFiles

First, I needed to understand how to create sound from code. I used the Python libraries Numpy for mathematical tools and SciPy for I/O to .wav files, to explore musical concepts like pitch, volume, timbre, and harmony.

## Part 2: sirens

## Part 3: acoustic arrangement

## Part 4: electronic arrangement
